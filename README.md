Specifying Systems in Alloy
We will introduce the Alloy specification language for modeling complex software systems.
Several companies like Amazon and Microsoft use modeling languages like Alloy and TLA+ for high level specifications of complex distributed applications to check assumptions about their design. We will go over some simple models in Alloy to get a feel for the language, then go over a real world model of user account transactions for a generic pay per use software as a service.  https://alloytools.org
